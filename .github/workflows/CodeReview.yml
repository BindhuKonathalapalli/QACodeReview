Here are the Issues I found for code quality issues 

Hardcoded file path:
In System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver", "C:\\Users\\Johny\\Downloads\\geckodriver-v0.33.0-win64\\geckodriver.exe");, the file path should be configurable or stored as a property.

Implicit Wait:
Instead of using implicit waits, which can lead to unexpected behavior, prefer explicit waits.

XPath usage:
The XPath expressions used are complex and brittle. Prefer using more robust locators or strategies such as CSS selectors.

Thread.sleep() usage: 
Using Thread.sleep() for waiting is not recommended. Prefer using explicit waits for synchronization.

Class within class: 
The class PagesforAutomationAssignment is defined within the Testcase101 class. It's better to define it in a separate file.

Missing imports:
There's a missing import statement for ChromeDriver in PagesforAutomationAssignment class.

Inconsistent code formatting: 
Code formatting should be consistent throughout the file for readability.

Comments: 
Comments are missing throughout the code, making it difficult to understand the purpose of certain actions or blocks of code.
